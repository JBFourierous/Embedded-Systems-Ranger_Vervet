# Embedded-Systems - Group 8 final project - RANGER VERVET
This repo contains source code and include files of the embedded system "Ranger Vervet". Both Inc and Src subfolders are divided in:
- ExternalHardware: drivers for external components;
- SystemLogic: source code representing the "mind" of the device;
- SystemCore: drivers for MCU;
- SystemWatchdog: software module that checks the status of the device.

This division is purely of support for the reader, actual release code does not follow this convention. The main program can be found in the SystemCore subfolder. 

For more detailed information about the system and the software architecture and behavior please refer to the official documentation, also attached in the repository.

The requirements file is the original one presented during projects definition, in the documentation a more accurate and precise Chapter is dedicated to this topic.

CubeMX project to prepare MCU peripherals is available too.
